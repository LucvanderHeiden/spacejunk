          <h2>No more space travel?</h2>
          <p>
            Not being able to travel into space anymore would be a huge loss for
            us all, but why is this even happening? Currently earth is being
            orbited by millions of objects. Some of these are space stations and
            satellites currently in use for a number of reasons. However, a
            large part of the space is being taken up by literal junk...
            spacejunk. This consists of old sattelites, broken equipment or
            simply debris from either of these. For objects to stay in orbit
            around the earth they have to travel at enormous speeds. These
            objects travel at around 7 kilometers per second. At that speed it
            would take you about one and a half hours to travel a complete
            circle around the earth.
