          <h2>NO MORE SPACE TRAVEL?</h2>
          <p>
            Humanity has been using satellites for more than half a decade for,
            among other applications, communication, observation, navigation and
            science. These satellites are sent up into space and are then placed
            in an orbit around the earth. This means they must gain enough speed
            to outrun the earth's gravity so that they are able to orbit the
            earth almost indefinitely. However, the amount of satellites
            currently in orbit around the earth is getting out of hand and if we
            don't collectively do something about this, the consequences will be
            very severe.

          <h4>IMPACT ON DAILY LIFE</h4>
          <p>
            Not being able to travel into space anymore would be a huge loss for
            us all, but why is this even happening? Currently earth is being
            orbited by millions of objects. Some of these are space stations and
            satellites currently in use for a number of reasons. However, a
            large part of the space is being taken up by literal junk...
            spacejunk. This consists of old sattelites, broken equipment or
            simply debris from either of these. For objects to stay in orbit
            around the earth they have to travel at enormous speeds. These
            objects travel at around 7 kilometers per second. At that speed it
            would take you about one and a half hours to travel a complete
            circle around the earth.

            So what can be done about this problem? There are solutions that can
            either prevent more space debris in the future and solutions that
            can clean up the debris currently in orbit around our planet.

              Not being able to travel into space anymore would be a huge loss
              for us all, but why is this even happening? Currently earth is
              being orbited by millions of objects. Some of these are space
              stations and satellites currently in use for a number of reasons.
              However, a large part of the space is being taken up by literal
              junk... spacejunk. This consists of old sattelites, broken
              equipment or simply debris from either of these. For objects to
              stay in orbit around the earth they have to travel at enormous
              speeds. These objects travel at around 7 kilometers per second. At
              that speed it would take you about one and a half hours to travel
              a complete circle around the earth.
