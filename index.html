            <h2>TO INFINITY AND BEYOND</h2>
            <p>
              In the second half of the 20th century, humanity ventured beyond
              Earth into the unknown. The space race between the United States
              and the Soviet Union unfolded, culminating in the historic launch
              of Sputnik 1 in 1957 and Yuri Gagarin's orbital feat in 1961. The
              United States followed with their Apollo missions and in landed,
              for the first time in history, on the moon in 1969.
            </p>

              Advancements in satellite technology defined the 1980s, impacting
              communication, weather monitoring, and scientific research.
              Satellite communications expanded to carry television programs,
              transforming how people receive information. Satellites played a
              pivotal role in discovering the ozone hole over Antarctica,
              pinpointing forest fires, and providing images of the Chernobyl
              nuclear disaster in 1986. Astronomical satellites, such as the
              Hubble Space Telescope and the more recent JWST, contributed to
              the exploration of new stars and offered a fresh perspective on
              the center of our galaxy. The knowlegde we gained by going into
              space changed the way we look at the universe and our place within
              it.

              The International Space Station, a symbol of international
              collaboration, has served as a continuous orbiting laboratory
              since the year 2000. This high-flying laboratory pushes humanity
              towards global cooperation in space exploration as it has been
              continuously occupied and serviced by a variety of visiting
              spacecraft, fostering collaboration among astronauts, cosmonauts,
              and space tourists from 17 different nations.

            <h2>NO MORE SPACE TRAVEL?</h2>
            <p>
              Humanity has been using satellites for more than half a decade
              for, among other applications, communication, observation,
              navigation and science. These satellites are sent up into space
              and are then placed in an orbit around the earth. This means they
              must gain enough speed to outrun the earth's gravity so that they
              are able to orbit the earth almost indefinitely. However, the
              amount of satellites currently in orbit around the earth is
              getting out of hand and if we don't collectively do something
              about this, the consequences will be very severe.

            Not being able to travel into space anymore would be a huge loss for
            us all, but why is this even happening? Currently earth is being
            orbited by millions of objects. Some of these are space stations and
            satellites currently in use for a number of reasons. However, a
            large part of the space is being taken up by literal junk...
            spacejunk. This consists of old sattelites, broken equipment or
            simply debris from either of these. For objects to stay in orbit
            around the earth they have to travel at enormous speeds. These
            objects travel at around 7 kilometers per second. At that speed it
            would take you about one and a half hours to travel a complete
            circle around the earth.
