            <p>
              In the second half of the 20th century, humanity ventured beyond
              Earth into the unknown. The space race between the United States
              and the Soviet Union unfolded, culminating in the historic launch
              of Sputnik 1 in 1957 and Yuri Gagarin's orbital feat in 1961. The
              United States followed with their Apollo missions and in landed,
              for the first time in history, on the moon in 1969.

              Advancements in satellite technology defined the 1980s, impacting
              communication, weather monitoring, and scientific research.
              Satellite communications expanded to carry television programs,
              transforming how people receive information. Satellites played a
              pivotal role in discovering the ozone hole over Antarctica,
              pinpointing forest fires, and providing images of the Chernobyl
              nuclear disaster in 1986. Astronomical satellites, such as the
              Hubble Space Telescope and the more recent JWST, contributed to
              the exploration of new stars and offered a fresh perspective on
              the center of our galaxy. The knowlegde we gained by going into
              space changed the way we look at the universe and our place within
              it.

              The International Space Station, a symbol of international
              collaboration, has served as a continuous orbiting laboratory
              since the year 2000. This high-flying laboratory pushes humanity
              towards global cooperation in space exploration as it has been
              continuously occupied and serviced by a variety of visiting
              spacecraft, fostering collaboration among astronauts, cosmonauts,
              and space tourists from 17 different nations.

              <!-- Humanity has been using satellites for more than half a decade
              for, among other applications, communication, observation,
              navigation and science. These satellites are sent up into space
              and are then placed in an orbit around the earth. This means they
              must gain enough speed to outrun the earth's gravity so that they
              are able to orbit the earth almost indefinitely. However, the
              amount of satellites currently in orbit around the earth is
              getting out of hand and if we don't collectively do something
              about this, the consequences will be very severe.-->
              These days it is difficult to imagine our lives without the
              constant and instant connectivity that we're used to. We don't
              just use our mobile phones to stay connected to our friends and
              family, we use them for vital information during our jobs,
              travelling and emergencies. However, space is getting busier every
              day. Where there were once only a handful of satellites, Earth is
              now surrounded by more than 1 million pieces of debris, which is
              travelling at enormously high speeds. If we don't do anything to
              stop this, space will get more and more crowded until one day
              we've reached a tipping point. Debris will collide with other
              debris, in turn creating a lot more debris, this will once again
              collide with more debris, creating a never ending chain reaction,
              until our entire planet is practically blanketed with debris. This
              hypothetical phenomenon is the called the Kessler problem and if
              we don't change our ways, it could be our future.

              There are currently more than 8,000 satellites orbiting Earth.
              Most of these satellites are in lower earth orbit (LEO). This
              means they travel in orbit around 500-1,000 kilometer above the
              Earth. The five most common uses for these satellites are:
              communication, Earth observation, technology development,
              navigation and space science. The amount of satellites being used
              for communication is more than all of the other types of
              satellites combined. <br />
              <br />

              Did you know that the average satellite used for communication or
              navigation is about the same size and weight as a bus?

            <p class="info-box-p">
              Currently there are more than 1 million pieces of debris in orbit
              around the Earth. Most of these are only a couple centimeters in
              size. This may not sound like much of an issue, but these parts
              are travelling at a speed of 7 kilometers per second. At that
              speed it would take you only about 90 minutes to travel around the
              Earth completely. Because of this these pieces of debris
              practically act like a bullet, only heavier, larger and faster.

              <br /><br />These are parts that have potentially broken off of
              satellites or in some cases they are the remains of crashed
              satellites. In 2009 two communications satellites collided in
              space. This collision caused at least 1,000 pieces of debris
              larger than 10 centimers. Because of the high velocity during the
              impact this debris was scattered in a wide area.

              When a rocket launches into space it will do so in stages. The
              boosters furthest on the bottom will expend all their full and the
              rocket will then decouple them, so as to lose unnecessary weight.
              Usually these parts will then fall back into the atmosphere where
              they either burn up or land somewhere on Earth to be recovered.
              However, sometimes these parts do not fall back to Earth, but
              instead keep floating around in space. These parts can be very
              large and therefor quite dangerous.

              spare glove, which is now still floating somewhere in orbit around
              the Earth. Astronaut Piers Sellers managed to lose a spatula in
              space in 2005. Lastly, during a 2007 spacewalk astronaut Sunita
              Williams lost grip of a special space camera, which proceeded to
              drift away from the ship.

          <h4>IMPACT ON DAILY LIFE</h4>
          <p>
            The looming threat of the Kessler Syndrome poses a direct risk to
            the daily lives of ordinary individuals. As the density of space
            debris continues to escalate, the potential consequences for our
            daily routines become increasingly tangible. Essential services that
            rely on satellites, such as weather forecasts, global navigation
            systems, and communication networks, may face disruptions. This
            means that the accuracy of weather predictions we rely on, the
            seamless functioning of our GPS navigation, and even the reliability
            of our everyday communication tools could be compromised. The
            implications are clear that the average person may find their daily
            life significantly influenced by the growing menace of space debris,
            highlighting the urgency of addressing this issue to safeguard our
            technological dependencies.

          <p>
            Imagine our cosmic playground turning into a chaotic space disco
            ball, thanks to the Kessler Syndrome. The mess up there isn't just a
            bummer for your stargazing plans; it's giving scientists and space
            explorers a real headache. Telescopes that once effortlessly
            captured the wonders of the universe might start playing
            hide-and-seek with rogue debris, making it hard to get those
            jaw-dropping shots of distant galaxies. Think about our space probes
            and rovers trying to navigate through a cosmic obstacle course. It's
            like trying to skateboard in a crowded mall during a shopping
            frenzy. Plus, launching new missions becomes riskier than playing
            intergalactic roulette. The Kessler Syndrome isn't just cramping our
            style; it's throwing a celestial spanner into the gears of our
            scientific exploration. So, if you were hoping for a front-row seat
            to humanity's cosmic adventures, you might want to root for a
            debris-free sky.

            <h4>FORCED RE-ENTRY</h4>
            <p>
              This technique has already been succesfully tested before. The
              idea is to slow down a piece of debris, for example an old
              satellite, so that it starts falling out of orbit. At some point
              it will re-enter the Earth's atmosphere where it will face more
              and more atmospheric resistance. This in turn will cause the
              satellite to heat up too incredibly high temperatures, which will
              cause it to burn up completely. This is not only an effective way
              to get rid of large pieces of space debris, it also has the added
              benefit of causing a beautiful and unique sight; a falling star.
              Some innovators, like Daan Roosegaarde, are already looking into
              the potential to, with enough coordination, turn these events into
              falling star shows. These could perhaps replace the need for
              fireworks shows, which in turn create a lot of debris on our own
              planet.

            <h4>RECYCLING IN SPACE</h4>
            <p>
              Recycling has become quite commonplace on our planet by now.
              However, this same push for recycling has not found its way into
              space yet. Repurposing and recycling space waste can offer a lot
              of advantages. By establishing a facility in Earth's orbit
              dedicated to repairing and repurposing satellites and discarded
              space objects, we can transform space trash into valuable
              resources for constructing future spacecraft and exploration
              outposts. This approach not only minimizes the need for new
              launches but also contributes to reducing overall space debris.
              Beyond the environmental benefits, recycling satellites can serve
              as a sustainable source of raw materials and potential revenue for
              funding future space endeavors. Additionally, this recycled
              technology could contribute to the development of advanced
              space-based instruments, such as cameras deployed on Gateway Earth
              to monitor the skies for potential asteroid threats.

            <h4>MITIGATION THROUGH LEGISLATION</h4>
            <p>
              Maybe the most important thing is to have a better plan for the
              future of space exploitation. Using space has huge economic and
              strategic value for a lot of companies and even countries. Given
              the freedom to do what they want, these parties will continue to
              use space for as long as it's viable to them. Therefor, it is
              extremely important that international commitees, such as the UN,
              set in place guidelines and laws that counteract the
              overutilization of space. Some institutions like the NASA and ESA
              are already planning on becoming space-debris neutral in the near
              future. This will be of great help, yet if other companies or
              institutions do not follow the problem will merely be slowed down,
              not solved.
